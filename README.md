# calc
a programmer-oriented calculator to show more data at once

I'm sure there's some bugs and issues with it (like it WILL overflow/underflow, since it's not designed to check, it's designed to do what it's told), but that's because it's not really meant to do more than just be a simple tool to modify bits and get hex or value data instantly with added tools for quick manipulation of that data.
